## 🔎 About  
StaySafe started on the idea of helping students find safe accommodations during their long-term stay in the university.  

Now it's a fully realized application built on Google's cross-device compatible framework: Flutter, featuring services on the Web Service side.  

1. **View Properties as a Guest**  
2. **Add/Edit/Archive Properties for Admin Accounts**  
3. **View Ratings of Your Properties**  

Adhering to modern design styles and functionality similar to web services such as AirBNB, StaySafe utilizes modular components behind the hood.  


## 🛠️ Frameworks  
Built using Google's Flutter + Dart Framework
